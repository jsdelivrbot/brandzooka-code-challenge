# Brandzooka Code Challenge

This Challenge was completed by Joshua Lerner on 09/20/2017

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

A prerequisite to running this application is to have node and npm installed
In order to run locally:
   - cd into the client directory
   - npm instal
   - npm start
The application should run on localhost:3000

## Running the tests

To run the tests, simply run the following command from the client directory:
   - $ npm test

### The Developer Tasks (that I received for this project)

1. We can't even show our progress to a client yet, there is no style whatsoever here. Make it look nicer. There's no need to reinvent the wheel here, you're allowed (encouraged even) to use some open source project(s) to help you along.

2. He, I don't actually want to do my todo, but I can't delete it. That's no good. Add this functionality in.

3. I'm really proud of having completed my ToDo, I wish there was a way I could tell everyone how awesome I am. Please add a way to share my completed ToDo on either Twitter or Facebook.

4. BONUS! Right now we lose all our ToDo's as soon as we refresh the page. It'd be really nice save these off somewhere so we don't lose the information. Do this somehow.


## Acknowledgments
